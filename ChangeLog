version 1.9.1

160808 Martin Mann
	- biu-2.3.5 : replaced by biu-2.3.7
	+ biu-2.3.7 : extended biu version
	* configure : 
		* biu-2.3.7 enabled
	* bin/latFold.cc :
		* uses now biu::RNG_ARS4x32, a counter-based generator from the 
		  Random123 library (thanks to Victor Zhao)
		* parameter "run" info extended
	* bin/latFoldVec.cc :
		* uses now biu::RNG_ARS4x32, a counter-based generator from the 
		  Random123 library (thanks to Victor Zhao)
		* parameter "run" info extended
		* now sets the RNG.seed for each run


160722 Martin Mann
	* bin/latFold.cc :
		* RNG seed set for each run, since LCG produced similar RNG runs for 
			long simulations with many runs (thanks to Victor Zhao)
			-> LCG should be avoided (thanks to Victor Zhao):
				http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jcc.21638
			-> maybe integrate Random123

version 1.9.0

100622 Martin Mann
	* latNum : space consumption is now close to zero since symmetry exclusion
	  is now done via the comparison of the move string to its normalized
	  version instead of storing all normalized structures within a set 
	  container
	
100621 Martin Mann
	+ latNum : number of lattice protein structures of a given length and their
	  symmetry free enumeration

100312 Martin Mann
	* configure :
	  - latFold default : disabled (since ELL ist not part of the package)
	  * BIU v2.3.5 is now part of the package
	* latFold : FCC folding uses now TRIANGULAR PULL MOVES (new default in BIU)
	  --> up to now latFold utilized "standard" square pull moves (Lesh et al)
	      for FCC resulting in larger neighborhoods and unneccesary move 
	      artefacts

version 1.8.1

091120 Martin Mann
	* latConv : 
	  * BUGFIX : base scaling for given bond length was wrong for FCC and 210
	    (thanks to Reda Rawi)
	  * now "-seq" accepts also non-HP-sequences ...

091117 Martin Mann
	* latMap :
	  + lowest distance for only backbone or only sidechain data if sidechain
	    models are given

091103 Martin Mann
	* latFit :
	  * BUGFIX : possible fragment starts (after gap bridging) are now checked
	    if they are valid nodes in the current lattice used

version 1.8.0

091018 Martin Mann
	* latFit :
	  * SAW bridging of chain gaps now restricted to short chain gaps (currently
	    up to length 6, see constant MAX_SAW_LENGTH_TO_CONSIDER
	  + for long chain gaps the approximate relative position to fit is 
	    determined via a superpositioning of the chain fitted so far. All 
	    lattice points around this position and their lattice neighbors are
	    considered for the start of the next fragment. A reflection is 
	    checked as well to ensure the correct superpositioning.

091015 Martin Mann
	* biu/SuperPos_Kabsch :
	  + superpositioning returns now the applied transformation information, 
	    i.e. translation vector, rotation matrix, and scaling factor

091007 Martin Mann
	* latFold / latFoldVec :
	  + new parameter "final" allows for the specification of a structure that
	    triggers the end of a folding simulation run
	    --> this is checked independently of the minimal energy ("minE") request
	* latFold :
	  * final structure printed for each run is now normalized

091005 Martin Mann
	* latFold :
	  + output of final structure per run
	  * hit rate output only if "minE" parameter present
	* latFoldVec :
	  * hit rate output only if "minE" parameter present

090929 Martin Mann
	* latFoldVec :
	  * now Boltzmann probabilities of neighbors is calculated based on energy
	    change to reduce maximal value of the partition function (was exceeding
	    range of <double> otherwise). still the same probabilities are 
	    maintained since all neighbored structures have the same 'energy anchor'
	    which is the elongated structure.
	* latFit :
	  + output of superpositioned original chain for dRMSD optimization 
	    reenabled

090925 Martin Mann
	* latFit :
	  * dRMSD optimization
	    + all chain fragments are now placed in same lattice (no independent
	      placements and orientation)
	    + distance between successive fragment ends are constrained by an 
	      according selfavoiding walk in the lattice, i.e. they could be 
	      connected via a backbone on the lattice
	    + progress bar output
	* BUGFIX : dRMSD calculation of two point sets used wrong normalization

090917 Martin Mann
	* latFoldVec :
	  + new parameter "-maxStepsIncrease" to trigger a linear increase of the
	    simulation length based on "maxSteps" times current sequence length
	  + PivotMoveSet enabled again

090915 Martin Mann
	* doc : latfold-manual : fix of "-kT" parameter docu thanks to Rada Rawi
	* latFoldVec : 
	  * energy calculation fixed 

090826 Martin Mann
	* energy files now installed to INSTALLDIR/share/latpack/
	* latFoldVec :
	  * BUGFIX : now only final structure/energy output for successful runs

090825 Martin Mann
	* latFoldVec :
	  * BUGFIX : chain elongation selection was uniform selection since all 
	    elongations were restricted to 1.0! now replaced with full Boltzmann
	    weight
	  + per default final structure and energy printed to STDOUT
	  * longer output buffering : only a few std::endl that trigger a flush()

090824 Martin Mann
	* DEPENDENCY UPDATE : ELL 3.1.2 and BIU 2.3.2
	* latFold : 
	  * beta --> kT
	* latFoldVec :
	  * BUGFIX : memory leak fixed
	  * initial structure CT based (not streched one)
	  * beta --> kT
	  + rerun of a folding simulation if a chain is not elongatable anymore
	  * time measurement updated such that each co-translational folding
	    simulation is measured and the overall time does not count for aborted
	    simulations

090822 Martin Mann
	* manuals of latFold and latVec : removed some inconsistencies and C&P 
	  errors
	+ latFoldVec : simulates co-translational/vectorial folding via a 
	  combination of a chain growth algorithm (as in latVec) and a global
	  folding simulation (as in latFold) for the intermediate protein chains
	+ manual for latFoldVec
